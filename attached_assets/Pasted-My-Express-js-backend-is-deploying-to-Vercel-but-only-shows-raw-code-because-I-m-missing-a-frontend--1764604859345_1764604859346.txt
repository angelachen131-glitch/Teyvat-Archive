My Express.js backend is deploying to Vercel but only shows raw code because I'm missing a frontend interface. I have character/artifact/team data stored in server/storage.ts that needs to be displayed in a user-friendly web interface.
Current Situation

Backend Express API working with TypeScript
Character data hardcoded in server/storage.ts with fields like: id, name, element, weapon, rarity, region, role, description, lore, talents, imageUrl
Using Vite build system
Deploying to Vercel but showing raw code instead of a website

What I Need
Create a complete frontend interface that displays my game character data:
1. Frontend Structure

Create a proper index.html in the project root
Add React components (or vanilla JS) to display the character roster
Style it with Tailwind CSS or vanilla CSS
Make it responsive and visually appealing

2. Display Features

Character Grid/List: Show all characters with their images, names, and basic info
Search/Filter: Allow filtering by element, region, role, rarity
Character Details: Click on a character to see full details (talents, lore, recommended artifacts/weapons)
Responsive Design: Works on mobile and desktop

3. API Integration

Fetch character data from the Express backend API endpoints
Handle loading states and errors gracefully
Display character images from the URLs in the data

4. File Organization
/
├── index.html          (Main entry point)
├── src/
│   ├── App.tsx/jsx     (Main React component)
│   ├── components/     (Character cards, filters, etc.)
│   └── styles/         (CSS files)
├── server/
│   ├── index.ts        (Express API - keep existing)
│   ├── routes.ts       (API routes - keep existing)
│   └── storage.ts      (Data - keep existing)
├── vercel.json         (Updated config for both frontend + API)
└── package.json        (Updated dependencies)
5. Vercel Configuration
Update vercel.json to:

Serve the built frontend from /dist
Route API calls to /api/* to the Express serverless functions
Handle all other routes to the frontend

6. Update package.json
Add necessary frontend dependencies:

React and ReactDOM (if using React)
Any UI libraries you recommend
Keep existing Express dependencies

7. Build Process

Frontend should build to dist/ folder
API should work as serverless functions in api/ folder
Both should work together when deployed to Vercel

Design Preferences

Gaming/fantasy theme that matches the character data (Genshin Impact style)
Clean, modern UI
Easy navigation
Show character element colors
Display rarity with stars or similar visual indicator

Important Requirements

Must work on Vercel's free tier
Keep all existing character data intact
API endpoints should remain functional
Frontend should be the default page visitors see
Make it look professional, not just functional

Please create all necessary files and update existing configuration to make this work as a complete full-stack application on Vercel.
