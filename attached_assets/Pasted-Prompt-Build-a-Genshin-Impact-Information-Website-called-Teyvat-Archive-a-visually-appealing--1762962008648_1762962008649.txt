Prompt:

Build a Genshin Impact Information Website called “Teyvat Archive” — a visually appealing, interactive site that helps players explore Genshin’s lore, characters, artifacts, and gameplay tips.

The website should serve as a complete guide for both new and experienced players, featuring filters, search tools, and detailed pages to make information easy to find.

🏠 1. Home Page

Overview of the Genshin Impact world (Teyvat) and main regions (Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma, Sumeru, Fontaine, Natlan).

Highlight sections such as “Characters,” “Artifacts,” “Team Builder,” and “Beginner’s Guide.”

Add a search bar that lets users quickly look up characters, artifacts, or regions by name.

Include a news or update panel (optional) for new content or patches.

💫 2. Character Database Page

Grid or card-style gallery of all playable characters.

Each card shows:

Character name

Element (Vision)

Weapon type

Rarity (Stars)

Main role (DPS/Support/Healer)

Include filters for:

Element (e.g. Pyro, Hydro, Cryo)

Weapon type (Sword, Bow, Claymore, Polearm, Catalyst)

Region (Mondstadt, Liyue, etc.)

Rarity (4★, 5★)

When a character is clicked, open a detail page showing:

Lore/background

Recommended team setups

Best artifacts and weapons

Talent leveling priorities

⚔️ 3. Artifacts & Runes Page

List all artifact sets and their stats, set bonuses (2-piece / 4-piece), and drop locations.

Include filters and search options:

Filter by Artifact Type (Flower, Feather, Sands, Goblet, Circlet)

Filter by Bonus Type (ATK%, HP%, Elemental Mastery, Crit Rate, etc.)

Filter by Location/Domain (where to farm)

Show recommended characters for each set.

🧩 4. Team Builder Page

Let users pick up to 4 characters.

Show elemental synergy and reactions (e.g., Melt, Vaporize, Overload).

Suggest best artifact combinations and support roles.

Allow exporting or saving favorite teams (optional).

📘 5. Beginner’s Guide Page

Step-by-step tips for new players:

Leveling characters and weapons

Adventure Rank progression

Resin management

Daily commissions and exploration

Include a “Starter Team” recommendation section.

🔍 6. Search & Filter System

Global search bar at the top of the website to quickly find:

Characters

Artifacts

Domains

Regions

Use dropdowns or checkboxes for filtering by:

Element / Weapon / Role

Artifact type or effect

Region or domain location

🎨 7. Design & Style

Clean and fantasy-inspired UI (similar to Genshin’s theme).

Use soft gradients, subtle shadows, and icons from Genshin-like resources.

Smooth hover animations, collapsible sections, and responsive grid layouts.

Include light/dark mode toggle.

⚙️ 8. Tech Stack

Use React or Next.js for a dynamic, SEO-friendly website.

Store character and artifact info in local JSON files or connect to the Genshin.dev API.

Ensure full mobile responsiveness.

⭐ 9. Bonus Features

“Favorites” feature to save characters, builds, or artifact sets.

“Domain Finder” page — users can search for a domain and see what artifacts it drops.

“Compare Builds” tool (optional advanced feature).

Footer with contact info, credits, and official Genshin links.

Goal:
Create an elegant, easy-to-use Genshin Impact website that combines lore, build guides, artifact filters, and player tips — helping users explore Teyvat and optimize their teams effortlessly.
